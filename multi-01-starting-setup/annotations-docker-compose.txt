docker compose is a way to initialize multiple containers with out doing it one 
by one. it is a standardized way to bring containers up and down. 

By default, every container that goes up in the docker compose is removed after it stops.
Also by default, docker compose creates a network with all the services declared in the docker-compose.yaml file. 

COMMANDS
docker compose up -d  -> runs everything in the docker-compose.ymal in detached mode.
the default network and volumes are named using a convention by the docker engine itself. 

docker compose down -v removes all the volumes when going down, but we doesn't need to do that.
docker compose down by default removes and deletes all the containers

BUILD

docker compose -build forces image building. by default, docker compose doesn't build an image if it finds it laying around the docker engine. 
but this behavior can be changed using the -build flag. matter of fact, we can build without running the containers, whereas, without the up command. 

CONTAINER NAMING:

in the docker-compose.yaml, it is possible to set a user defined name by passing the key container-name: name. by default, docker names containers using the directory
path reference with an auto increment identifier associated to it. such as: directory_folder_1.
