by running the command below, I'm building up from a base node image to full blown node app binding mouting the container into the host filesystem. 
docker run -it -v C:\Users\User\Desktop\sts-420\docker-course\utility-containers\node-uc:/app node-util npm init

ENTRYPOINT 

it works like a restriction to the container. it must take an argument of the specified entry point. in the example, the entry point is the npm. then, while docker running 
the container I must pass on what I need to ben ran. 

docker run -it -v C:\Users\User\Desktop\sts-420\docker-course\utility-containers\node-uc:/app node-util <command-here>
