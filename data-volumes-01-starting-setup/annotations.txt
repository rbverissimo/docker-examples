Each container has its own filesystem with a read-write stream in which we can save files inside of the container.
Matter of fact, the image is a file so to say inside the container. 
This means that we can instruct the dockerfile to create files and directories at our leisure, much like in a real machine. 
We the image may interact with these files such as in-file databases and other files. 

Now, here's the thing. Each container has its own filesystem, much like a real machine. So if we create a container and just start/stop it, fine, our files will be there.
BUT, if we remove a container, all the files are gone. And just another dockerfile that will build a new image within a new container will only create new files. 
It is an interesting concept, but overall that's where volumes come into the play.

docker volumes is the command that manages all the volumes data

Volumes are a way to connect the host machine with the container read-write filesystem. 
It's like a path stream on which the container may be aware of files in the host and vice-versa. 

There are two kinds of volumes:
Unnamed: they are non-persistent. They declared in the dockerfile via

VOLUME ['path\to\container\dir']

Named: they are persistent. They declare IN THE RUN command

docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name feedback-app -v feedback:app/feedback feedback-node:volumes

using -v passing the host-dir:container/dir with it

It is important to remember that every time a container rans, we must specify the named volume path for it to be aware of the volume
