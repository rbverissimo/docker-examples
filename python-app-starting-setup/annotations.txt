docker start -a -i 
This command starts the container, once used the docker run -it command, in attached mode but also in the interactive mode. 
That means that we, as users, can interact with the terminal of the container for STDIN/STDOUT. 

docker rm <name-container> removes a container if stopped (docker stop <name-container> to stop)

docker run prune removes all the containers at once

docker images lists all the images 
docker rmi <image-id> removes the image selected by the ID. But, you can only remove images if they are not being used by any container (stopped also) anymore.

docker image prune removes all the images that can be removed

RECAP:

docker run -p 3000:80 -d -rm <ID>

The command above runs a container biding the 3000 port of the host to the 80 port of the container and it does so in detach mode,
but it also removes the container after it gets stopped. The ID just identifies which container will be ran. 

docker clear cleans the docker terminal

docker image inspect <ID> inspects the layers inside of an image selected by the ID 


COPYING FILES IN AND OUT A CONTAINER

The basic command stands for docker cp <src> <destination>
What does it mean? It means that I can point source to inside of the container and extract it to outside and vice-versa

NAMING IMAGES AND containers

docker --name can be passed along with a docker run command, just like:

docker run -d --name myApp <ID>   this line just runs the container in detached mode assigning a nome to it
docker stop myApp  and once assigned I can start or stop it by its name
