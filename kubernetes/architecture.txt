Core concepts & architecture

There is a pod (holds multiple containers, at least one).
Pods lives inside worker nodes which by themselves are wrapped in a cluster.
This cluster also has a master node with the control plane to control the state of the workers.

Each worker has, besides the pod, a proxy (an address resolver) that makes the access to the node possible.

The cluster talks to the cloud provider API in order to get the orchestration running properly in the cloud environment. 

WORKER NODE

- talks to the master node through the kubelet
- there is also a proxy to communicate with the outside world
- there could be different pods with different containers and volumes and IP inside a worker node
- pods are created and managed by the kubernetes infra

MASTER NODE 

- there is an API server that talks to the worker's kubelets
- the scheduler takes care of newly created pod and assign them to worker nodes
- kube-controller-manager is the entity that takes of the worker nodes state
- cloud-controller-manager is the facade that talks to the cloud provider
