emptyDir: assign a mount inside the container on which the volume will be mounted with a clean slate. the clean slate part is very important. 
this type of volume works but has with downsides: it is closely related to the pod on which the volume is mounted on. 

hostPath: a bit like bind mounts in simple containers, it mounts a path of on the host worker node. what problem does it solves?
since the volume is mounted on the host, many different pods of the worker node may access it. so, regarding emptyDir, the mounting isn't
closely attached to a specific pod, rather in a specific node.

CSI (Container Storage Interface): 

Persistent Volumes: are side car storages in the cluster, a remote access storage system that doesn't participate pods and nodes' lifecycles

PV Claims: a n-n relationship between nodes and persistent volumes.
