k8s is an open-source system for automating deployment

problems of manual deployment:

1. security and configuration
2. containers might go down and need replacement
3. the need for more (or even less) containers on traffic spikes
4. load balancing between containers might be needed

AWS ECS benefits

1. health check
2. auto scalling out of the box
3. application load balancing

but it locks the application to a specific cloud provider

why kubernetes ?

1. orchestrator of containers
2. the de facto standard with extensible, yet standardized configuration
3. it's a collection of concepts and tools for orchestration 
4. it's not a paid service

kubernetes is docker-compose for multiple machines
