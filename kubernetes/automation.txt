kubectl set image deployment/<name-deployment> <container-name>=<docker-hub-image-name>:<tag> 

k8s really needs the tag to autodeploy

the k8s engine is optmistic when it comes to updates, if you set an unvalid update, you remove it from the history doing

kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name-deployment> 

and this command will simply rollback the last deployment. see the history:

kubectl rollout history deployment/<name-deployment>

its possible to also pass a -to--revision tag to rollback to previous versions of the application
